@s Library Entry-point

I need to define an entry-point file for the library so that NPM can package it
properly.

I want the library to be usable by importing specific modules to aid in
self-documenting code.

--- index.js
import Functor from './Functor';

export {
  Functor
};
---

However I also want to allow users to just import all the functions if they wish.

--- index.js --- +=
export default {
  ...Functor
};
---

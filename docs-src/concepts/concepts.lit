@title Concepts

This document will outline the concepts used in this library and how you can apply them. It will provide both a generic overview of the concepts, and the specific implementation of them in this library.

I use the [Flow](https://flow.org) type system for Javascript throughout the implementation. You can read the chapter [Flow Basics](concepts/flow/flow.lit) for an introduction to the basics necessary for understanding the code.
